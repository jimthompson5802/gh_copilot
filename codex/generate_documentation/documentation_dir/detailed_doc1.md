The `_MultivariateOLSResults` class represents the results of the multivariate OLS model. It has a `mv_test` method that performs hypothesis tests based on the fitted model and returns an instance of `MultivariateTestResults` class.

The `MultivariateTestResults` class represents the results of the hypothesis tests. It has a `summary` method that generates a summary of the test results, including the test statistics and p-values.

Overall, the code provides a comprehensive implementation of multivariate linear regression using OLS and includes functions for fitting the model, performing hypothesis tests, and generating summary statistics.

## Function **`_multivariate_ols_fit`** Overview
The function `_multivariate_ols_fit` is used to perform multivariate ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. It takes in two parameters: `endog` (the dependent variable) and `exog` (the independent variables). 

The function first checks if the number of observations in `endog` and `exog` are the same. If not, it raises a `ValueError`. 

Next, it calculates the necessary matrices for hypothesis testing. If the `method` parameter is set to 'pinv', it uses the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse to calculate the regression coefficients matrix (`params`) and the inverse of the matrix product of `exog` and its transpose (`inv_cov`). It also calculates the sums of squares and cross-products of residuals (`sscpr`). 

If the `method` parameter is set to 'svd', it uses the singular value decomposition (SVD) to calculate the regression coefficients matrix (`params`), the inverse of the matrix product of `exog` and its transpose (`inv_cov`), and the sums of squares and cross-products of residuals (`sscpr`). 

If the `method` parameter is neither 'pinv' nor 'svd', it raises a `ValueError`. 

The function returns a tuple containing the regression coefficients (`params`), the degrees of freedom of the residuals (`df_resid`), the inverse covariance matrix (`inv_cov`), and the sums of squares and cross-products of residuals (`sscpr`).

### **Function Details**
This code defines a function called `_multivariate_ols_fit` that performs multivariate ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. 

The function takes three arguments: `endog`, `exog`, and `method`. 
- `endog` is a numpy array representing the dependent variable(s) in the regression. 
- `exog` is a numpy array representing the independent variable(s) in the regression. 
- `method` is a string specifying the method to use for the regression. The default method is 'svd', but 'pinv' is also supported. 

The function first checks if the number of observations in `endog` and `exog` are the same. If not, it raises a ValueError. 

Next, it calculates the degrees of freedom for the residuals. 

If the method is 'pinv', it calculates the regression coefficients matrix using the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of `exog` (denoted as `pinv_x`). It also calculates the inverse of the covariance matrix of `exog` (denoted as `inv_cov`). If the rank of `inv_cov` is less than the number of independent variables, it raises a ValueError. Finally, it calculates the sums of squares and cross-products of residuals (denoted as `sscpr`) and returns the regression coefficients, degrees of freedom, inverse covariance matrix, and `sscpr`.

If the method is 'svd', it performs singular value decomposition (SVD) on `exog` to obtain the matrices `u`, `s`, and `v`. It checks if any of the singular values are smaller than a tolerance value. If so, it raises a ValueError. It then calculates the regression coefficients, inverse covariance matrix, and `sscpr` using the SVD results and returns them.

If the method is neither 'pinv' nor 'svd', it raises a ValueError.

Note: The code assumes that the necessary libraries (e.g., numpy) have been imported.

## Function **`multivariate_stats`** Overview
The function `multivariate_stats` takes in several parameters: `eigenvals`, `r_err_sscp`, `r_contrast`, `df_resid`, and an optional parameter `tolerance`. It performs calculations and returns a DataFrame containing various statistical values.

The function calculates different multivariate statistical measures based on the given input parameters. It computes the values for "Wilks' lambda", "Pillai's trace", "Hotelling-Lawley trace", and "Roy's greatest root". These measures are commonly used in multivariate analysis to assess the significance of differences between groups or conditions.

The function uses the input parameters to perform calculations and populate the DataFrame with the computed values. It utilizes numpy and pandas libraries for mathematical operations and data manipulation. The function also uses the `stats` module from the scipy library to calculate p-values using the F-distribution.

The resulting DataFrame contains the computed statistical values for each measure, including the value itself, the degrees of freedom, the F-value, and the p-value. The DataFrame has a specific structure with predefined columns and index labels.

Overall, the `multivariate_stats` function provides a convenient way to calculate and organize various multivariate statistical measures for further analysis and interpretation.

### **Function Details**
This code defines a function called `multivariate_stats` that calculates various statistics for multivariate analysis. The function takes the following parameters:

- `eigenvals`: a numpy array of eigenvalues
- `r_err_sscp`: a scalar representing the residual sum of squares and cross products
- `r_contrast`: a scalar representing the contrast sum of squares and cross products
- `df_resid`: a scalar representing the degrees of freedom for the residuals
- `tolerance`: a scalar representing the tolerance for determining which eigenvalues to include in the calculations (default is 1e-8)

The function first assigns the input parameters to local variables `v`, `p`, `q`, and `s`. It then calculates the number of eigenvalues greater than the tolerance and assigns it to `n_e`. It also calculates `eigv2` as the subset of eigenvalues greater than the tolerance and `eigv1` as the reciprocal of each eigenvalue in `eigv2`.

The function then creates an empty DataFrame called `results` with columns named 'Value', 'Num DF', 'Den DF', 'F Value', and 'Pr > F', and index values corresponding to different statistics.

Next, the function defines a helper function `fn` that returns the real part of a complex number.

The function then calculates the values for each statistic and assigns them to the corresponding cells in the `results` DataFrame.

Finally, the function calculates the degrees of freedom and F-values for each statistic, calculates the p-values using the `stats.f.sf` function from the `scipy` library, and assigns them to the corresponding cells in the `results` DataFrame.

The function returns the `results` DataFrame.

## Function **`_multivariate_ols_test`** Overview
The function `_multivariate_ols_test` is a helper function that is used to perform a multivariate ordinary least squares (OLS) test. 

The function takes four arguments: `hypotheses`, `fit_results`, `exog_names`, and `endog_names`. 

- `hypotheses` is a list of hypothesis matrices that define the null hypotheses to be tested. 
- `fit_results` is a tuple containing the results of the OLS regression, including the estimated parameters, the degrees of freedom of the residuals, the inverse covariance matrix, and the sum of squared centered predicted residuals. 
- `exog_names` is a list of names for the exogenous variables in the regression. 
- `endog_names` is a list of names for the endogenous variables in the regression. 

The function defines an inner function `fn` that takes three arguments: `L`, `M`, and `C`. 

- `L` is a matrix that defines the linear combination of the estimated parameters to be tested. 
- `M` is a matrix that defines the linear combination of the observed variables to be tested. 
- `C` is a matrix that defines the constant term in the linear combination. 

Inside the `fn` function, the function calculates the test statistic for the null hypothesis using the provided matrices and the fit results from the OLS regression. 

- The first step is to calculate `t1`, which is the linear combination of the estimated parameters. 
- Then, `t2` is calculated as the product of `L`, the inverse covariance matrix, and the transpose of `L`. 
- The rank of `t2` is calculated and stored in `q`. 
- Finally, the test statistic `H` is calculated as the product of `t1`, the inverse of `t2`, and the transpose of `t1`. 

The function also calculates the error term `E` using the observed variables and the sum of squared centered predicted residuals. 

The function returns the error term `E`, the test statistic `H`, the rank `q`, and the degrees of freedom of the residuals. 

The function then calls another function `_multivariate_test` with the calculated values and returns the result.

### **Function Details**
The code defines a function called `_multivariate_ols_test` that takes in four arguments: `hypotheses`, `fit_results`, `exog_names`, and `endog_names`. 

Inside the function, there is a nested function called `fn` that takes in three arguments: `L`, `M`, and `C`. This nested function is used to calculate the test statistics for the multivariate OLS test.

The code then extracts the necessary values from the `fit_results` variable, which is assumed to be a tuple containing the estimated parameters, the degrees of freedom of the residuals, the inverse covariance matrix, and the sum of squared centered predicted residuals.

Next, the code calculates the first test statistic `t1` by multiplying `L` with the estimated parameters `params` and `M`, and subtracting `C`.

The code then calculates the matrix `t2` by multiplying `L` with the inverse covariance matrix `inv_cov`, and then multiplying the result with the transpose of `L`.

The code uses the `matrix_rank` function to calculate the rank `q` of the matrix `t2`.

Finally, the code calculates the test statistics `E` and `H` by multiplying `M` with the sum of squared centered predicted residuals `sscpr`, and by multiplying `t1` with the inverse of `t2` and then with `t1` transposed, respectively.

The function then returns the test statistics `E`, `H`, `q`, and `df_resid` as a tuple.

The code also calls another function `_multivariate_test` and passes the test statistics and other arguments to it. However, the implementation of this function is not provided in the code snippet.

## Function **`_multivariate_test`** Overview
The function `_multivariate_test` takes in four parameters: `hypotheses`, `exog_names`, `endog_names`, and `fn`. 

The `hypotheses` parameter is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a hypothesis. The length of each tuple can be 2, 3, or 4. The first element of the tuple is the name of the hypothesis, the second element is the contrast matrix `L`, the third element is the transform matrix `M`, and the fourth element is the constant matrix `C`. The function checks the length of each tuple and assigns the values accordingly.

The `exog_names` parameter is a list of names for the exogenous variables, and the `endog_names` parameter is a list of names for the endogenous variables.

The `fn` parameter is a function that takes in the contrast matrix `L`, transform matrix `M`, and constant matrix `C` as arguments and returns four values: `E`, `H`, `q`, and `df_resid`.

The function then iterates over each hypothesis in the `hypotheses` list. It checks the type of each element in `L`, `M`, and `C` and performs necessary validations. It calculates the values of `E`, `H`, `q`, and `df_resid` by calling the `fn` function. It calculates the rank of the sum of `E` and `H` and sorts the eigenvalues of the inverse of `E + H` multiplied by `H`. It then calls the `multivariate_stats` function to calculate the statistical values based on the eigenvalues, rank, `q`, and `df_resid`. Finally, it stores the results in a dictionary with the hypothesis name as the key and the calculated values as the value.

The function returns the dictionary of results.

### **Function Details**
This code defines a function called `_multivariate_test` that takes in four arguments: `hypotheses`, `exog_names`, `endog_names`, and `fn`. 

The `hypotheses` argument is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a hypothesis. Each hypothesis tuple can have 2, 3, or 4 elements. The first element is the name of the hypothesis, the second element is the contrast matrix `L`, the third element is the transform matrix `M`, and the fourth element is the constant matrix `C`. 

The `exog_names` argument is a list of names for the exogenous variables, and the `endog_names` argument is a list of names for the endogenous variables. 

The `fn` argument is a function that takes in the contrast matrix `L`, transform matrix `M`, and constant matrix `C`, and returns four values: `E`, `H`, `q`, and `df_resid`. 

Inside the function, the number of exogenous variables `k_xvar` and the number of endogenous variables `k_yvar` are calculated based on the lengths of `exog_names` and `endog_names`, respectively. 

A dictionary called `results` is created to store the results for each hypothesis. 

The function then iterates over each hypothesis in the `hypotheses` list. If the length of the hypothesis tuple is 2, 3, or 4, the name, contrast matrix `L`, transform matrix `M`, and constant matrix `C` are assigned accordingly. If any of the elements in `L` or `M` are strings, they are converted to linear constraints using the `DesignInfo` class. 

Next, the function checks the dimensions of `L`, `M`, and `C` to ensure they are valid. 

The function then calls the `fn` function with `L`, `M`, and `C` as arguments to calculate `E`, `H`, `q`, and `df_resid`. 

The sum of `E` and `H` is calculated and stored in `EH`. 

The rank of `EH` is calculated using the `matrix_rank` function and stored in `p`. 

The eigenvalues of the inverse of `EH` multiplied by `H` are calculated and sorted in ascending order. 

A function called `multivariate_stats` is called with the sorted eigenvalues, `p`, `q`, and `df_resid` as arguments to calculate a statistic table. 

The results for the current hypothesis are stored in the `results` dictionary with the name of the hypothesis as the key. 

Finally, the `results` dictionary is returned.

## Class **`_MultivariateOLS`** Overview
The class _MultivariateOLS is a subclass of the Model class. It is used to fit multivariate ordinary least squares (OLS) models. 

The __init__ method initializes the _MultivariateOLS object with the given endogenous variables (dependent variables) and exogenous variables (independent variables). It checks if the endog array has more than one dependent variable, and raises a ValueError if it does not.

The fit method fits the multivariate OLS model using the specified method. It calls the _multivariate_ols_fit function to perform the fitting and stores the fitted model in the _fittedmod attribute. It returns an instance of the _MultivariateOLSResults class, which contains the results of the fitting process.

### Method **`__init__`** Overview
The `__init__` method is a special method in Python classes that is automatically called when an object of the class is created. It is used to initialize the object's attributes and perform any necessary setup.

In the given code, the `__init__` method is defined with several parameters: `self`, `endog`, `exog`, `missing`, `hasconst`, and `**kwargs`. 

The `self` parameter refers to the instance of the class that is being created. It is automatically passed to the method when it is called.

The `endog` parameter represents the dependent variable(s) in a multivariate OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) regression. The `exog` parameter represents the independent variable(s) or predictors.

The `missing` parameter is optional and specifies how missing values in the data should be handled. The default value is 'none', indicating that missing values are not allowed.

The `hasconst` parameter is also optional and specifies whether a constant term should be included in the regression model. The default value is `None`, which means that the presence of a constant term is determined automatically.

The `**kwargs` parameter allows for additional keyword arguments to be passed to the method.

Inside the method, there is a conditional statement that checks the shape of the `endog` variable. If it has only one dimension or if the second dimension has a size of 1, a `ValueError` is raised, indicating that there must be more than one dependent variable for multivariate OLS.

Finally, the `super()` function is used to call the `__init__` method of the superclass (parent class) of `_MultivariateOLS`. This ensures that any initialization code in the superclass is also executed.

Overall, the `__init__` method in this code initializes the attributes of the `_MultivariateOLS` object and performs some validation checks on the input variables.

#### **Method Details**
This code defines the `__init__` method for a class called `_MultivariateOLS`. This class is likely a subclass of another class, possibly related to multivariate ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.

The `__init__` method takes several arguments:
- `self`: a reference to the instance of the class
- `endog`: the dependent variable(s) for the regression
- `exog`: the independent variable(s) for the regression
- `missing`: a string indicating how missing values should be handled (default is 'none')
- `hasconst`: a boolean indicating whether the model includes a constant term (default is None)
- `**kwargs`: additional keyword arguments that can be passed to the superclass's `__init__` method

The method first checks the shape of the `endog` variable. If it is a 1-dimensional array or if it has only one column, a `ValueError` is raised, indicating that there must be more than one dependent variable for multivariate OLS.

If the shape check passes, the method calls the `__init__` method of the superclass (presumably the superclass of `_MultivariateOLS`). The `endog`, `exog`, `missing`, `hasconst`, and `**kwargs` arguments are passed to the superclass's `__init__` method using the `super()` function.

### Method **`fit`** Overview
The method "fit" is a method of a class that fits a multivariate ordinary least squares (OLS) model to the data. It takes an optional argument "method" which specifies the method to be used for fitting the model. The default method is "svd". 

Inside the "fit" method, the "_multivariate_ols_fit" function is called with the endogenous variable (self.endog) and the exogenous variables (self.exog) as inputs, along with the specified method. This function performs the actual fitting of the OLS model and returns the fitted model.

The fitted model is then stored in the "_fittedmod" attribute of the class instance. Finally, an instance of the "_MultivariateOLSResults" class is created with the fitted model as input, and returned as the result of the "fit" method.

#### **Method Details**
The given code defines a `fit` method for a class. This method fits a multivariate ordinary least squares (OLS) model to the data.

The `fit` method takes an optional argument `method`, which specifies the method to use for fitting the model. The default value is `'svd'`.

Inside the `fit` method, the `_multivariate_ols_fit` function is called with the `endog` and `exog` attributes of the class as arguments, along with the `method` argument. The result of this function call is stored in the `_fittedmod` attribute of the class.

Finally, an instance of the `_MultivariateOLSResults` class is created with the current instance as an argument, and returned.

Note: The code snippet provided is incomplete and does not include the definition of the `_multivariate_ols_fit` and `_MultivariateOLSResults` classes.

## Class **`_MultivariateOLSResults`** Overview
The class `_MultivariateOLSResults` is a class that represents the results of a multivariate ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. It is initialized with a fitted multivariate OLS model. 

The class has several attributes:
- `design_info`: This attribute stores the design information of the fitted model, which includes information about the terms in the model.
- `exog_names`: This attribute stores the names of the exogenous variables in the model.
- `endog_names`: This attribute stores the names of the endogenous variables in the model.
- `_fittedmod`: This attribute stores the fitted multivariate OLS model.

The class also has a `__str__` method that returns a string representation of the summary of the results.

The class has a `mv_test` method that performs a multivariate hypothesis test. It takes an optional argument `hypotheses`, which specifies the hypotheses to test. If `hypotheses` is not provided, the method automatically generates hypotheses based on the design information of the model. The method returns the results of the hypothesis test as a `MultivariateTestResults` object.

The class has a `summary` method that raises a `NotImplementedError`. This method is meant to be overridden by subclasses to provide a summary of the results.

### Method **`__init__`** Overview
The `__init__` method is a special method in Python classes that is automatically called when an object is created from the class. It is used to initialize the attributes of the object.

In this specific code, the `__init__` method takes a parameter `fitted_mv_ols` and assigns its attributes to the corresponding attributes of the object being created. 

First, it checks if the `fitted_mv_ols` object has a `data` attribute and if that `data` attribute has a `design_info` attribute. If both conditions are true, it assigns the `design_info` attribute of `fitted_mv_ols.data` to the `design_info` attribute of the object being created. Otherwise, it assigns `None` to the `design_info` attribute.

Next, it assigns the `exog_names` attribute of `fitted_mv_ols` to the `exog_names` attribute of the object being created.

Then, it assigns the `endog_names` attribute of `fitted_mv_ols` to the `endog_names` attribute of the object being created.

Finally, it assigns the `_fittedmod` attribute of `fitted_mv_ols` to the `_fittedmod` attribute of the object being created.

Overall, the `__init__` method initializes the attributes of the object being created based on the attributes of the `fitted_mv_ols` object passed as a parameter.

#### **Method Details**
This code defines an `__init__` method for a class. The method takes in a parameter `fitted_mv_ols` and initializes several attributes of the class based on the properties of `fitted_mv_ols`.

The method first checks if `fitted_mv_ols` has a `data` attribute and if that `data` attribute has a `design_info` attribute. If both conditions are true, it assigns the value of `fitted_mv_ols.data.design_info` to the `design_info` attribute of the class. Otherwise, it assigns `None` to `design_info`.

Next, it assigns the value of `fitted_mv_ols.exog_names` to the `exog_names` attribute of the class and the value of `fitted_mv_ols.endog_names` to the `endog_names` attribute.

Finally, it assigns the value of `fitted_mv_ols._fittedmod` to the `_fittedmod` attribute of the class.

Overall, this code is used to initialize the attributes of a class based on the properties of an object passed as a parameter.

### Method **`__str__`** Overview
The method __str__ is a special method in Python that is used to define a string representation of an object. It is called by the built-in str() function and is used to provide a human-readable description of the object.

In the given code, the __str__ method is defined within a class. It calls the summary() method of the object and converts the returned value to a string using the __str__ method of the summary object. The converted string is then returned as the string representation of the object.

By implementing the __str__ method, you can customize how an object is represented as a string when it is printed or converted to a string using the str() function. This allows you to provide meaningful and informative descriptions of your objects.

#### **Method Details**
The given code is a method definition for the `__str__` method in a class. This method is used to define the string representation of an object of that class.

In this code, the `__str__` method is defined to return the string representation of the object's `summary` attribute. The `summary` attribute is assumed to be a method or property of the object that returns a string.

The `__str__` method is called when the `str()` function is used on an object or when the object is used in a string context (e.g., when using the `print` function).

Here's an example of how this code could be used:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.summary = "This is a summary"

    def __str__(self):
        return self.summary.__str__()

obj = MyClass()
print(obj)  # Output: This is a summary
```

In this example, an object of the `MyClass` class is created and its `summary` attribute is set to the string "This is a summary". When the `print` function is called on the object, the `__str__` method is automatically invoked and it returns the string representation of the `summary` attribute, which is then printed to the console.

### Method **`mv_test`** Overview
The method `mv_test` is a function that performs multivariate hypothesis testing in a linear regression model. It takes in three parameters: `self`, `hypotheses`, and `skip_intercept_test`.

If the `hypotheses` parameter is not provided, the method generates a set of hypotheses based on the design information of the model. It creates a list of hypotheses for each term in the design, excluding the intercept term if `skip_intercept_test` is set to `True`. Each hypothesis consists of a key (term name), a contrast matrix `L_contrast`, and a `None` value for the test statistic.

If the `hypotheses` parameter is provided, the method directly uses the given hypotheses.

The method then calls the `_multivariate_ols_test` function, passing the hypotheses, the fitted model, the names of the exogenous variables, and the names of the endogenous variables. This function performs the actual multivariate hypothesis testing and returns the results.

Finally, the method creates a `MultivariateTestResults` object using the returned results, the names of the endogenous variables, and the names of the exogenous variables. This object is then returned by the `mv_test` method.

#### **Method Details**
This code defines a method called `mv_test` within a class. The method takes three parameters: `self`, `hypotheses`, and `skip_intercept_test`. 

The `self` parameter refers to the instance of the class that the method is being called on. 

The `hypotheses` parameter is an optional parameter that defaults to `None`. If no value is provided for `hypotheses`, the method will generate a set of hypotheses based on the design information of the model. 

The `skip_intercept_test` parameter is a boolean flag that determines whether or not to skip the intercept test. If set to `True`, the method will skip the test for the intercept term in the model. 

The method first determines the number of exogenous variables (`k_xvar`) by counting the number of names in the `exog_names` attribute of the class. 

If no hypotheses are provided, the method generates a set of hypotheses based on the design information of the model. If the design information is available, the method iterates over the terms in the design information and creates a contrast matrix (`L_contrast`) for each term. If the `skip_intercept_test` flag is set to `True`, the method skips the test for the intercept term. Each hypothesis is represented as a list containing the term name, the contrast matrix, and `None` (indicating that no specific alternative hypothesis is specified). 

If the design information is not available, the method generates a set of hypotheses based on the number of exogenous variables. For each variable, a contrast matrix (`L`) is created with a single 1 in the corresponding position. Each hypothesis is represented as a list containing the variable name, the contrast matrix, and `None`. 

The method then calls a function called `_multivariate_ols_test` with the generated hypotheses, the fitted model (`self._fittedmod`), the exogenous variable names (`self.exog_names`), and the endogenous variable names (`self.endog_names`). The results of the test are stored in the `results` variable. 

Finally, the method returns an instance of a `MultivariateTestResults` class, passing the `results`, the endogenous variable names, and the exogenous variable names as arguments.

### Method **`summary`** Overview
The method summary is a placeholder method that raises a NotImplementedError. This means that the method is not implemented and needs to be overridden in a subclass. The purpose of this method is to provide a general summary or description of the object or class it belongs to. By raising a NotImplementedError, it serves as a reminder for the developer to implement the summary method in the subclass to provide a specific summary for that particular object or class.

#### **Method Details**
The code provided is a method definition for a function called "summary" within a class. The "self" parameter suggests that this method is intended to be used within an object instance of the class.

The code currently raises a NotImplementedError, which is a built-in exception in Python. This exception is typically used to indicate that a method or function has not been implemented yet and needs to be overridden in a subclass or implemented in the current class.

In this case, the "summary" method is not implemented and will raise the NotImplementedError when called. The implementation of this method should be added by the developer to provide the desired functionality.

## Class **`MultivariateTestResults`** Overview
The class MultivariateTestResults is used to store and manipulate the results of a multivariate linear model. 

The class has the following attributes:
- results: a dictionary that stores the statistical results of the model
- endog_names: a list of the names of the endogenous variables in the model
- exog_names: a list of the names of the exogenous variables in the model

The class has the following methods:
- __str__: returns a string representation of the summary of the model results
- __getitem__: allows accessing the statistical results using indexing
- summary_frame: returns the results as a multiindex dataframe
- summary: returns a summary of the model results, including statistical measures and optional additional information such as contrast, transformation, and constant values.

### Method **`__init__`** Overview
The `__init__` method is a special method in Python classes that is automatically called when an object is created from the class. It is used to initialize the attributes of the object.

In this specific code, the `__init__` method takes in three parameters: `results`, `endog_names`, and `exog_names`. These parameters are used to initialize the attributes of the object.

The `results` parameter is assigned to the `results` attribute of the object. The `endog_names` parameter is converted to a list using the `list()` function and assigned to the `endog_names` attribute. Similarly, the `exog_names` parameter is converted to a list and assigned to the `exog_names` attribute.

Overall, the `__init__` method initializes the attributes of the object with the values passed as parameters.

#### **Method Details**
This code defines a class with an initializer method. The initializer method takes three parameters: "results", "endog_names", and "exog_names". 

Inside the initializer method, the "results" parameter is assigned to the instance variable "self.results". The "endog_names" parameter is converted to a list using the "list()" function and assigned to the instance variable "self.endog_names". Similarly, the "exog_names" parameter is converted to a list and assigned to the instance variable "self.exog_names". 

The purpose of this class is not clear from the provided code snippet. It seems to be a class that stores some results, endogenous variable names, and exogenous variable names.

### Method **`__str__`** Overview
The method __str__ is a special method in Python that is used to define a string representation of an object. It is called by the built-in str() function and is used to provide a human-readable description of the object.

In the given code, the __str__ method is defined within a class. It calls the summary() method of the object and converts the returned value to a string using the __str__ method of the summary object. The converted string is then returned as the string representation of the object.

By implementing the __str__ method, you can customize how an object is represented as a string when it is printed or converted to a string using the str() function. This allows you to provide meaningful and informative descriptions of your objects.

#### **Method Details**
The given code is a method definition for the `__str__` method in a class. This method is used to define the string representation of an object of that class.

In this code, the `__str__` method is defined to return the string representation of the object's `summary` attribute. The `summary` attribute is assumed to be a method or property of the object that returns a string.

The `__str__` method is called when the `str()` function is used on an object or when the object is used in a string context (e.g., when using the `print` function).

Here's an example of how this code could be used:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self.summary = "This is a summary"

    def __str__(self):
        return self.summary.__str__()

obj = MyClass()
print(obj)  # Output: This is a summary
```

In this example, an object of the `MyClass` class is created and its `summary` attribute is set to the string "This is a summary". When the `print` function is called on the object, the `__str__` method is automatically invoked and it returns the string representation of the `summary` attribute, which is then printed to the console.

### Method **`__getitem__`** Overview
The method __getitem__ is a special method in Python that allows objects to be accessed using the square bracket notation. It is used to define the behavior of the object when it is indexed or sliced using square brackets.

In the given code, the __getitem__ method is defined within a class. It takes two parameters - self (which refers to the instance of the class) and item (which represents the index or slice being accessed).

The method returns the value of the item at the specified index from the "results" attribute of the object. It allows the object to be treated like a sequence or a container, enabling the retrieval of specific elements or slices from it using the square bracket notation.

For example, if an instance of the class is created and assigned to a variable called "obj", the __getitem__ method can be used to access elements of the "results" attribute like this:

obj[0]  # Returns the value at index 0 of the "results" attribute
obj[2:5]  # Returns a slice of the "results" attribute from index 2 to 4

By implementing the __getitem__ method, the object becomes iterable and supports indexing and slicing operations, making it more versatile and compatible with other Python code that expects these behaviors.

#### **Method Details**
This code defines the `__getitem__` method for a class. This method is used to implement the indexing behavior for objects of this class. 

The `__getitem__` method takes an argument `item`, which represents the index or key used to access an element of the object. 

Inside the method, it returns the value of `self.results[item]`, which retrieves the element at the specified index or key from the `results` attribute of the object.

### Method **`summary_frame`** Overview
The method `summary_frame` takes no arguments and returns the results of a statistical analysis as a multi-index dataframe. 

The method iterates over the keys in the `self.results` dictionary, which contains the statistical results for different effects. For each key, it creates a copy of the 'stat' dataframe and adds a new column called 'Effect' with the value of the key. 

The resulting dataframes are appended to a list called `df`. After iterating over all the keys, the method concatenates the dataframes in `df` along the row axis using `pd.concat`. 

The resulting dataframe is then set with a multi-index, where the first level is 'Effect' and the second level is 'index'. The method sets the names of the index levels to 'Effect' and 'Statistic' respectively using `df.index.set_names`. 

Finally, the method returns the resulting dataframe.

#### **Method Details**
The code defines a method called `summary_frame` that returns the results as a multi-index dataframe. 

The method first initializes an empty list called `df`. Then, it iterates over the keys in the `results` dictionary of the object (`self`). For each key, it creates a copy of the 'stat' dataframe associated with that key and assigns it to the variable `tmp`. 

Next, a new column called 'Effect' is added to the `tmp` dataframe, with the value set to the current key. 

The `tmp` dataframe is then appended to the `df` list. 

After iterating over all the keys, the `df` list is concatenated along the axis 0 (rows) using `pd.concat` to create a single dataframe. 

The resulting dataframe is then set to have a multi-index with levels 'Effect' and 'index' using `df.set_index(['Effect', 'index'])`. 

Finally, the names of the index levels are set to 'Effect' and 'Statistic' using `df.index.set_names(['Effect', 'Statistic'], inplace=True)`. 

The resulting dataframe is returned.

### Method **`summary`** Overview
The method "summary" is a function that generates a summary of a multivariate linear model. It takes three optional boolean parameters: show_contrast_L, show_transform_M, and show_constant_C. 

The method creates an instance of the "Summary" class and adds a title to it. Then, for each key in the "results" dictionary, it adds an empty dictionary to the summary, copies the statistical results into a dataframe, modifies the column and index labels, and adds the dataframe to the summary. 

If the show_contrast_L parameter is True, it adds a dictionary entry with the key and the string ' contrast L=', and then adds a dataframe containing the contrast_L values to the summary. 

If the show_transform_M parameter is True, it adds a dictionary entry with the key and the string ' transform M=', and then adds a dataframe containing the transform_M values to the summary. 

If the show_constant_C parameter is True, it adds a dictionary entry with the key and the string ' constant C=', and then adds a dataframe containing the constant_C values to the summary. 

Finally, it returns the summary object.

#### **Method Details**
This code defines a method called "summary" that takes in three boolean parameters: show_contrast_L, show_transform_M, and show_constant_C. 

The method creates an instance of the "Summary" class from the "summary2" module and adds a title to it. 

Then, for each key in the "results" attribute of the object, the method performs the following steps:

1. Adds an empty dictionary to the summary.
2. Copies the "stat" attribute of the "results[key]" object to a new DataFrame called "df" and resets its index.
3. Modifies the column names of "df" by replacing the first column name with the current key.
4. Modifies the index of "df" by setting it to four empty strings.
5. Adds "df" to the summary.
6. If show_contrast_L is True, adds a dictionary entry with the key as the current key and the value as ' contrast L=' to the summary.
7. Creates a new DataFrame called "df" from the "contrast_L" attribute of the "results[key]" object, with column names as "exog_names".
8. Adds "df" to the summary.
9. If show_transform_M is True, adds a dictionary entry with the key as the current key and the value as ' transform M=' to the summary.
10. Creates a new DataFrame called "df" from the "transform_M" attribute of the "results[key]" object, with index as "endog_names".
11. Adds "df" to the summary.
12. If show_constant_C is True, adds a dictionary entry with the key as the current key and the value as ' constant C=' to the summary.
13. Creates a new DataFrame called "df" from the "constant_C" attribute of the "results[key]" object.
14. Adds "df" to the summary.

Finally, the method returns the "summ" object.
