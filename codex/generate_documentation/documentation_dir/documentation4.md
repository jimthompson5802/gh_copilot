The code is a module that provides functions and classes for performing multivariate linear regression analysis. Here is a description of each function, method, and class:

- `_multivariate_ols_fit`: This function fits a multivariate linear regression model using either the singular value decomposition (SVD) or the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse method. It calculates the regression coefficients, the inverse of the covariance matrix, and the sums of squares and cross-products of residuals.

- `multivariate_stats`: This function calculates various statistics for hypothesis testing in multivariate linear regression. It takes as input the eigenvalues, the residual sums of squares and cross-products, and the degrees of freedom. It returns a DataFrame containing the values, degrees of freedom, F-values, and p-values for different test statistics.

- `_multivariate_ols_test`: This function performs hypothesis testing in multivariate linear regression. It takes as input a list of hypotheses, the fit results from `_multivariate_ols_fit`, and the names of the exogenous and endogenous variables. It calls the `_multivariate_test` function to perform the actual tests.

- `_multivariate_test`: This function performs hypothesis testing in multivariate linear regression. It takes as input a function `fn` that calculates the test statistics and degrees of freedom for a given hypothesis. It iterates over the list of hypotheses and calls `fn` for each hypothesis. It returns a dictionary containing the test results for each hypothesis.

- `_MultivariateOLS`: This class represents a multivariate linear regression model. It inherits from the `Model` class in the `statsmodels` library. It has a `fit` method that fits the model using the `_multivariate_ols_fit` function.

- `_MultivariateOLSResults`: This class represents the results of a fitted multivariate linear regression model. It takes as input a fitted `_MultivariateOLS` object and stores the design information, exogenous and endogenous variable names, and the fitted model results. It has a `mv_test` method that performs hypothesis testing using the `_multivariate_ols_test` function.

- `MultivariateTestResults`: This class represents the results of hypothesis testing in multivariate linear regression. It takes as input the results dictionary from `_multivariate_ols_test`, the names of the endogenous and exogenous variables, and provides methods for accessing and summarizing the test results. It has a `summary_frame` property that returns the test results as a multi-index DataFrame. It also has a `summary` method that returns a summary of the test results in a formatted string.

Note: The code is written in Python and uses various libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, pandas, and statsmodels. The code is written in a modular and object-oriented manner, making it easy to use and extend for multivariate linear regression analysis.
