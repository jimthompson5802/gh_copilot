The code is a Python implementation of multivariate linear regression. It includes functions for fitting the regression model, performing hypothesis tests, and summarizing the results.

The `_multivariate_ols_fit` function fits the multivariate linear regression model using either the singular value decomposition (SVD) or the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse method. It calculates the regression coefficients, the inverse of the covariance matrix, and the sums of squares and cross-products of residuals.

The `multivariate_stats` function calculates various statistics for hypothesis testing, including Wilks' lambda, Pillai's trace, Hotelling-Lawley trace, and Roy's greatest root.

The `_multivariate_ols_test` function performs hypothesis tests for the multivariate linear regression model. It takes a set of hypotheses, contrast matrices, and transform matrices as input and calculates the test statistics and p-values.

The `_MultivariateOLS` class is a wrapper for the multivariate linear regression model. It initializes the model with the dependent and independent variables and provides a `fit` method to estimate the model parameters.

The `_MultivariateOLSResults` class stores the results of the multivariate linear regression model. It provides methods for hypothesis testing and summarizing the results.

The `MultivariateTestResults` class stores the results of the hypothesis tests. It provides methods for accessing and summarizing the test results.

Overall, the code allows for fitting multivariate linear regression models, performing hypothesis tests, and summarizing the results.
