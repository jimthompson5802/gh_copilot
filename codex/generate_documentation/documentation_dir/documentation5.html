The code is a Python implementation of multivariate linear regression using ordinary least squares (OLS). It includes functions for fitting the regression model, performing hypothesis tests, and generating summary statistics.

The main function in the code is `_multivariate_ols_fit`, which takes the endogenous variables (`endog`) and exogenous variables (`exog`) as input and fits the OLS model. It calculates the regression coefficients, the inverse of the covariance matrix, and the sums of squares and cross-products of residuals.

The code also includes a function `multivariate_stats` that calculates various statistics for hypothesis testing, such as Wilks' lambda, Pillai's trace, Hotelling-Lawley trace, and Roy's greatest root.

The function `_multivariate_ols_test` performs hypothesis tests based on the fitted model. It takes a list of hypotheses, each specified as a tuple of the form `(name, L, M, C)`, where `name` is the name of the hypothesis, `L` is the contrast matrix, `M` is the transform matrix, and `C` is the constant matrix. It uses the function `fn` to calculate the test statistics and degrees of freedom.

The class `_MultivariateOLS` is a wrapper for the OLS model, providing a convenient interface for fitting the model and accessing the results. The class `_MultivariateOLSResults` stores the results of the fitted model and provides methods for accessing and summarizing the results.

The class `MultivariateTestResults` stores the results of hypothesis tests and provides methods for accessing and summarizing the results.

The code also includes a function `summary` that generates a summary of the fitted model or the hypothesis test results in HTML format. The function `summary_frame` returns the results as a multi-index dataframe.

Overall, the code provides a comprehensive implementation of multivariate linear regression using OLS and includes functions for fitting the model, performing hypothesis tests, and generating summary statistics.
