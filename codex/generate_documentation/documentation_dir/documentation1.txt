The code is a Python implementation of multivariate linear regression. It includes functions for fitting the regression model, performing hypothesis tests, and summarizing the results.

The `_multivariate_ols_fit` function fits the multivariate linear regression model using either the singular value decomposition (SVD) or the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse method. It calculates the regression coefficients, the inverse of the covariance matrix, and the sums of squares and cross-products of residuals.

The `multivariate_stats` function calculates various statistics for hypothesis testing, including Wilks' lambda, Pillai's trace, Hotelling-Lawley trace, and Roy's greatest root.

The `_multivariate_ols_test` function performs hypothesis tests for the multivariate linear regression model. It takes a list of hypotheses, each specified as a tuple of the form (name, L, M, C), where L is the contrast matrix, M is the transform matrix, and C is the constant matrix. It calls the `multivariate_stats` function to calculate the test statistics and returns the results.

The `_MultivariateOLS` class is a wrapper for the multivariate linear regression model. It inherits from the `Model` class in the statsmodels library and provides a `fit` method to fit the model using the `_multivariate_ols_fit` function.

The `_MultivariateOLSResults` class is a container for the results of the multivariate linear regression model. It provides methods for accessing and summarizing the results, including the `mv_test` method for performing hypothesis tests.

The `MultivariateTestResults` class is a container for the results of the hypothesis tests. It provides methods for accessing and summarizing the results, including the `summary` method for generating a summary table.

Overall, the code provides a comprehensive implementation of multivariate linear regression, including model fitting, hypothesis testing, and result summarization.
