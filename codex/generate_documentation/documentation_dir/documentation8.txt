This code defines a function called `_multivariate_ols_fit` that performs multivariate ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. 

The function takes three arguments: `endog`, `exog`, and `method`. 
- `endog` is a numpy array representing the dependent variable(s) in the regression. 
- `exog` is a numpy array representing the independent variable(s) in the regression. 
- `method` is a string indicating the method to use for calculating the regression coefficients and other statistics. The default method is 'svd', but 'pinv' is also supported. 

The function first checks if the number of observations in `endog` and `exog` are the same. If not, it raises a ValueError. 

Next, it calculates the degrees of freedom for the residuals. 

If the method is 'pinv', it calculates the regression coefficients using the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of `exog` and the formula `params = pinv_x.dot(y)`. It also calculates the inverse of `x'x` (where `x'` is the transpose of `x`) using the pseudoinverse and checks if it is singular. Finally, it calculates the sums of squares and cross-products of residuals using the formula `sscpr = np.subtract(y.T.dot(y), t.T.dot(t))`, where `t = x.dot(params)`.

If the method is 'svd', it performs singular value decomposition (SVD) on `exog` using the `svd` function. It checks if any of the singular values are below a tolerance value and raises a ValueError if so. It then calculates the regression coefficients using the SVD components and the formula `params = v.T.dot(np.diag(invs)).dot(u.T).dot(y)`. It also calculates the inverse of `x'x` using the SVD components and checks if it is singular. Finally, it calculates the sums of squares and cross-products of residuals using the formula `sscpr = np.subtract(y.T.dot(y), t.T.dot(t))`, where `t = np.diag(s).dot(v).dot(params)`.

If the method is neither 'pinv' nor 'svd', it raises a ValueError.

The function returns a tuple containing the regression coefficients (`params`), the degrees of freedom for the residuals (`df_resid`), the inverse of `x'x` (`inv_cov`), and the sums of squares and cross-products of residuals (`sscpr`).
