# Stock Analyzer

Demonstration of Codex's ability to generate code for a stock analyzer in both Python and Fortran.

## Python Version
## Overview
Prompt:
```text
/explain selected code

```

The selected Python code performs two main tasks: 

1. It reads stock data from a CSV file and calculates some statistics for the 'Close' prices.
2. It calculates the prices of call and put options using the Black-Scholes formula.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

- The `pandas` library is imported to handle data manipulation and analysis.

- The `pd.read_csv()` function is used to read the CSV file containing the stock data.

- The `describe()` function is used to generate descriptive statistics of the 'Close' prices, which include central tendency, dispersion, and shape of the dataset’s distribution.

- `numpy` is imported for numerical operations, and `scipy.stats` is imported for statistical functions.

- Assumed values for the stock price (S), strike price (K), risk-free rate (r), time to maturity (T), and volatility (sigma) are defined.

- The Black-Scholes formula is used to calculate the prices of call and put options. The formula requires the calculation of `d1` and `d2` parameters first.

- `norm.cdf()` is the cumulative distribution function for a normal distribution. It's used in the Black-Scholes formula to calculate the probabilities of different outcomes.

- The calculated call and put prices are then printed to the console.

### Code Review

**Good Practices:**

1. **Use of Libraries:** The use of libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `scipy.stats` is a good practice as these libraries are well-tested and optimized for performance.

2. **Data Analysis:** The use of the `describe()` function to get a statistical summary of the 'Close' prices is a good practice for initial data analysis.

3. **Clear Variable Naming:** The variables are named clearly (S for stock price, K for strike price, etc.), which makes the code easier to understand.

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Error Handling:** The code should include error handling for file operations. For example, it should handle cases where the file does not exist, or the file is not in the expected format.

2. **Data Validation:** Before performing calculations, the code should validate the data. For example, it should check for missing or null values in the 'Close' prices.

3. **Secure Data Handling:** If the CSV file contains sensitive information, appropriate measures should be taken to secure the data. This could include encrypting the data at rest and in transit.

4. **Code Documentation:** The code should include comments explaining what each part of the code does. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

5. **Unit Testing:** The code should include unit tests to ensure that the calculations are correct. This is especially important for the Black-Scholes formula calculations.

6. **Hardcoded Values:** The code should avoid hardcoded values for variables like the stock price, strike price, risk-free rate, time to maturity, and volatility. These values could be inputs to the function or read from a configuration file.

7. **Code Organization:** All imports should be at the top of the file. This makes it easier to see all dependencies at a glance. In your code, `numpy` and `scipy.stats` are imported after some other code has already been executed.

## Fortran Version
### Overview
Prompt:
```text
/explain selected code
```

The selected code is written in Fortran and it's a program for analyzing stock data. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. The program starts by declaring variables. These include variables for storing data read from a CSV file (like date, open, high, low, close, adjusted close, and volume), variables for storing calculated values (like sum, mean, min, max), and variables for calculating option prices (like strike price, risk-free rate, volatility, time to maturity).

2. The program opens a CSV file named 'AAPL.csv' for reading. The file is expected to contain stock data.

3. The program reads the first line of the file, which is assumed to be a header line, and discards it.

4. The program then enters a loop where it reads each line of the file. Each line is expected to contain the date, open, high, low, close, adjusted close, and volume. The close price is stored in an array named `close_prices`.

5. If the `close_prices` array is already allocated, it moves the allocation to `close_prices_new`, allocates `close_prices` with a new size, copies the old values back, and adds the new close price. If `close_prices` is not allocated, it allocates it and stores the close price.

6. After reading all lines, if there are any close prices, the program calculates the sum, mean, min, and max of the close prices and prints them.

7. The program then initializes variables for calculating option prices and calculates the prices of call and put options using the Black-Scholes formula. The Black-Scholes formula is a mathematical model used to calculate the theoretical price of options.

8. The program prints the calculated call and put option prices.

9. Finally, the program closes the file.

10. The program also contains a function named `cdf_normal` which calculates the cumulative distribution function for a normal distribution. This function is used in the calculation of the Black-Scholes formula.

### Code Review

Good Practices:

1. The code uses `implicit none` at the beginning. This is a good practice in Fortran as it requires all variables to be explicitly declared, which can help prevent errors.

2. The code checks the status of the `read` operation with `iostat=io`. This is a good practice as it allows the program to handle end-of-file conditions gracefully.

3. The code uses `allocatable` arrays, which allows dynamic allocation of memory. This is a good practice as it allows the program to handle data of unknown size.

4. The code uses the `contains` keyword to define a function within the program. This is a good practice as it keeps related code together.

Areas for Improvement:

1. Error Handling: The code does not handle potential errors when opening the file. It's good practice to check if the file was opened successfully.

2. Hardcoded Values: The code uses hardcoded values for the stock price, strike price, risk-free rate, volatility, and time to maturity. These could be parameters to the program or read from an input file for more flexibility.

3. Memory Management: The code reallocates the `close_prices` array for every new data point. This could be inefficient for large data sets. Consider allocating larger chunks of memory at a time, or using a data structure better suited for dynamic size changes, like a linked list.

4. Variable Naming: Some variable names could be more descriptive. For example, `io` could be `read_status` to better reflect its purpose.

5. Code Comments: While the code has some comments, more could be added to explain what each section of the code does, especially the complex calculations.

6. Data Validation: The code does not validate the data read from the file. It's good practice to check if the data is in the expected format and range.

7. File Path: The file path is hardcoded which might lead to issues if the file is not present in the expected location. Consider making the file path a parameter or a configurable option.
