``` 
Python code to retrieve stock price for AAPL from 1/1/2023 to 11/18/2023. print the closing prices. Compute daily and cumulative returns. Combine into closing prices and the returns into a single dataframe and print it.
```

``` 
plot the daily and cumulative returns and save as png image
```


``` 
Get the last closing price and compute the one year black scholes call and put option for a strike prices of $185 with a risk free rate of 0.02 and compute the volatility from the retrieved stock data.
```

GitHub Copilot: This Python script does the following:

1. Imports necessary libraries for data fetching, data manipulation, plotting, and mathematical operations.

2. Defines the start and end dates for which the stock data will be fetched.

3. Specifies the ticker symbol for the company whose stock data will be fetched. In this case, it's "AAPL" for Apple Inc.

4. Fetches the stock data for the specified company and period using the `yfinance` library.

5. Extracts the closing prices from the fetched stock data.

6. Computes the daily returns, which is the percentage change in closing prices from the previous day.

7. Computes the cumulative returns, which is the cumulative product of the daily returns.

8. Combines the closing prices, daily returns, and cumulative returns into a single DataFrame.

9. Renames the columns of the DataFrame for clarity.

10. Plots the daily and cumulative returns and saves the plot as a PNG image.

11. Defines the parameters for the Black-Scholes formula, which is used to calculate the price of call and put options. The parameters include the last closing price, strike price, risk-free rate, time to expiration, and volatility. The volatility is computed from the daily returns.

12. Prints the parameters for the Black-Scholes formula.

13. Calculates the price of the call and put options using the Black-Scholes formula.

14. Prints the prices of the call and put options.
