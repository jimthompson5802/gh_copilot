## Review for Function **`generate_documentation`**
## Feedback:

### Good Coding Practices:
- The function has a clear and descriptive docstring that explains its purpose, arguments, return value, and any potential exceptions.
- The function uses meaningful variable names.
- The function follows the PEP 8 style guide for formatting.
- The function includes an example in the docstring to demonstrate how to use it.

### Suggestions for Improvement:
- The function is missing an import statement for the `tiktoken` module, which is used to compute the token size. This should be added at the beginning of the code.
- The constant `THIS_LLM` is used in the code, but it is not defined anywhere. It should be defined or replaced with the appropriate value.
- The function includes a `print` statement that outputs the token size. This print statement should be removed or commented out, as it is not necessary for the function to work correctly.
- The function makes a call to the OpenAI API, but it does not handle any potential errors that may occur. It would be good to add error handling code to catch and handle any `OpenAIError` exceptions that may be raised.
- The function could benefit from some additional error checking and validation of the input arguments. For example, it could check if the `prompt` and `source_code` arguments are of the correct data types and raise appropriate exceptions if they are not.
- The function could be further improved by adding more detailed comments within the code to explain the purpose and functionality of each section.

Overall, the function follows good coding practices but could benefit from some improvements to handle errors and validate input arguments.
