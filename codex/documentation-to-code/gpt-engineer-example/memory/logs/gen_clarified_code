Model:\n   - Snake: Represents the snake in the game. Responsible for maintaining the snake's position, length, and movement.\n   - Food: Represents the food in the game. Responsible for generating new food at random positions.\n   - Game: Represents the game state. Responsible for managing the game logic, including collision detection and score tracking.\n\n2. View:\n   - Renderer: Responsible for rendering the game state on the screen.\n\n3. Controller:\n   - InputHandler: Responsible for handling user input and updating the game state accordingly.\n\nNow, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and implementing the code.\n\n1. main.py\n\n```python\nimport pygame\nfrom controller import InputHandler\nfrom model import Game\nfrom view import Renderer\n\ndef main():\n    pygame.init()\n    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))\n    pygame.display.set_caption(\"Snake Game\")\n\n    game = Game()\n    renderer = Renderer(screen)\n    input_handler = InputHandler(game)\n\n    clock = pygame.time.Clock()\n\n    running = True\n    while running:\n        for event in pygame.event.get():\n            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n                running = False\n            input_handler.handle_event(event)\n\n        game.update()\n        renderer.render(game)\n\n        pygame.display.flip()\n        clock.tick(10)\n\n    pygame.quit()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n2. model.py\n\n```python\nfrom dataclasses import dataclass\nfrom enum import Enum\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\nclass Direction(Enum):\n    UP = 0\n    DOWN = 1\n    LEFT = 2\n    RIGHT = 3\n\n@dataclass\nclass Snake:\n    body: List[Tuple[int, int]]\n    direction: Direction\n\n@dataclass\nclass Food:\n    position: Tuple[int, int]\n\nclass Game:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.snake = Snake([(10, 10), (10, 11), (10, 12)], Direction.RIGHT)\n        self.food = Food((5, 5))\n        self.score = 0\n\n    def update(self):\n        # Update snake position and check for collisions\n        # Update score if food is eaten\n        pass\n```\n\n3. view.py\n\n```python\nimport pygame\n\nclass Renderer:\n    def __init__(self, screen):\n        self.screen = screen\n\n    def render(self, game):\n        self.screen.fill((0, 0, 0))\n        # Render snake, food, and score on the screen\n        pass\n```\n\n4. controller.py\n\n```python\nimport pygame\nfrom model import Direction\n\nclass InputHandler:\n    def __init__(self, game):\n        self.game = game\n\n    def handle_event(self, event):\n        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:\n            if event.key == pygame.K_UP:\n                self.game.snake.direction = Direction.UP\n            elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:\n                self.game.snake.direction = Direction.DOWN\n            elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:\n                self.game.snake.direction = Direction.LEFT\n            elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:\n                self.game.snake.direction = Direction.RIGHT\n```\n\nThis is a basic implementation of the snake game using the MVC architecture. The main entry point is the `main.py` file, which initializes the game, renderer, and input handler, and runs the game loop. The `model.py` file contains the classes for the game model, including the snake, food, and game state. The `view.py` file handles rendering the game state on the screen. The `controller.py` file handles user input and updates the game state accordingly."}]
