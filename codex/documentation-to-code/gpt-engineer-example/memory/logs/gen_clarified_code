Responsible for generating new food at random positions.\n- Game: Represents the game state. Responsible for managing the game loop, updating the snake and food positions, and handling collisions.\n\n2. View:\n- Renderer: Responsible for rendering the game state on the screen.\n\n3.

The main entry point is the `main.py` file, which initializes the game, handles user input, updates the game state, and renders the game on the screen. The `model.py` file contains the classes for the snake, food, and game logic. The `view.py` file handles rendering the game state on the screen. The `controller.py` file handles user input and updates the snake's direction accordingly.\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified implementation and may require additional features and optimizations depending on the specific requirements of the snake game."}]
