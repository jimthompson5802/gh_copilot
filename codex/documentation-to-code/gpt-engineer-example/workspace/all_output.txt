Based on the requirements, here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for the snake game implementation:

1. Model:
- Snake: Represents the snake in the game. Responsible for maintaining the snake's position, length, and movement.
- Food: Represents the food in the game. Responsible for generating new food at random positions.
- Game: Represents the game state. Responsible for managing the game loop, updating the snake and food positions, and handling collisions.

2. View:
- Renderer: Responsible for rendering the game state on the screen.

3. Controller:
- InputHandler: Responsible for handling keyboard input and updating the snake's direction accordingly.

Now, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and implementing the code.

1. main.py

```python
import pygame
from model import Snake, Food, Game
from view import Renderer
from controller import InputHandler

def main():
    pygame.init()
    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))
    pygame.display.set_caption("Snake Game")

    snake = Snake()
    food = Food()
    game = Game(snake, food)
    renderer = Renderer(screen)
    input_handler = InputHandler(snake)

    clock = pygame.time.Clock()

    while not game.game_over:
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                game.game_over = True
            input_handler.handle_event(event)

        game.update()
        renderer.render(game)

        pygame.display.update()
        clock.tick(10)

    pygame.quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

2. model.py

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from enum import Enum
import pygame

class Direction(Enum):
    UP = 0
    DOWN = 1
    LEFT = 2
    RIGHT = 3

@dataclass
class Snake:
    position: list
    direction: Direction
    length: int

    def move(self):
        if self.direction == Direction.UP:
            self.position[1] -= 10
        elif self.direction == Direction.DOWN:
            self.position[1] += 10
        elif self.direction == Direction.LEFT:
            self.position[0] -= 10
        elif self.direction == Direction.RIGHT:
            self.position[0] += 10

@dataclass
class Food:
    position: list

    def generate_food(self):
        self.position = [random.randint(0, 79) * 10, random.randint(0, 59) * 10]

class Game:
    def __init__(self, snake, food):
        self.snake = snake
        self.food = food
        self.game_over = False

    def update(self):
        self.snake.move()
        self.check_collision()

    def check_collision(self):
        if self.snake.position == self.food.position:
            self.snake.length += 1
            self.food.generate_food()

        if self.snake.position[0] < 0 or self.snake.position[0] >= 800 or self.snake.position[1] < 0 or self.snake.position[1] >= 600:
            self.game_over = True

        # Check collision with snake's body
        for segment in self.snake.position[1:]:
            if segment == self.snake.position[0]:
                self.game_over = True

```

3. view.py

```python
import pygame

class Renderer:
    def __init__(self, screen):
        self.screen = screen

    def render(self, game):
        self.screen.fill((0, 0, 0))
        pygame.draw.rect(self.screen, (255, 255, 255), pygame.Rect(game.food.position[0], game.food.position[1], 10, 10))

        for segment in game.snake.position:
            pygame.draw.rect(self.screen, (0, 255, 0), pygame.Rect(segment[0], segment[1], 10, 10))
```

4. controller.py

```python
import pygame
from model import Direction

class InputHandler:
    def __init__(self, snake):
        self.snake = snake

    def handle_event(self, event):
        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_UP and self.snake.direction != Direction.DOWN:
                self.snake.direction = Direction.UP
            elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN and self.snake.direction != Direction.UP:
                self.snake.direction = Direction.DOWN
            elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT and self.snake.direction != Direction.RIGHT:
                self.snake.direction = Direction.LEFT
            elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT and self.snake.direction != Direction.LEFT:
                self.snake.direction = Direction.RIGHT
```

This is the basic implementation of the snake game using the MVC pattern in separate files. The main entry point is the `main.py` file, which initializes the game, handles user input, updates the game state, and renders the game on the screen. The `model.py` file contains the classes for the snake, food, and game logic. The `view.py` file handles rendering the game state on the screen. The `controller.py` file handles user input and updates the snake's direction accordingly.

Please note that this is a simplified implementation and may require additional features and optimizations depending on the specific requirements of the snake game.
