Based on the MVC architecture, the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for the snake game are as follows:

1. Model:
   - Snake: Represents the snake in the game. Responsible for maintaining the snake's position, length, and movement.
   - Food: Represents the food in the game. Responsible for generating new food at random positions.
   - Game: Represents the game state. Responsible for managing the game logic, including collision detection and score tracking.

2. View:
   - Renderer: Responsible for rendering the game state on the screen.

3. Controller:
   - InputHandler: Responsible for handling user input and updating the game state accordingly.

Now, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and implementing the code.

1. main.py

```python
import pygame
from controller import InputHandler
from model import Game
from view import Renderer

def main():
    pygame.init()
    screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))
    pygame.display.set_caption("Snake Game")

    game = Game()
    renderer = Renderer(screen)
    input_handler = InputHandler(game)

    clock = pygame.time.Clock()

    running = True
    while running:
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                running = False
            input_handler.handle_event(event)

        game.update()
        renderer.render(game)

        pygame.display.flip()
        clock.tick(10)

    pygame.quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

2. model.py

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from enum import Enum
from typing import List, Tuple

class Direction(Enum):
    UP = 0
    DOWN = 1
    LEFT = 2
    RIGHT = 3

@dataclass
class Snake:
    body: List[Tuple[int, int]]
    direction: Direction

@dataclass
class Food:
    position: Tuple[int, int]

class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.snake = Snake([(10, 10), (10, 11), (10, 12)], Direction.RIGHT)
        self.food = Food((5, 5))
        self.score = 0

    def update(self):
        # Update snake position and check for collisions
        # Update score if food is eaten
        pass
```

3. view.py

```python
import pygame

class Renderer:
    def __init__(self, screen):
        self.screen = screen

    def render(self, game):
        self.screen.fill((0, 0, 0))
        # Render snake, food, and score on the screen
        pass
```

4. controller.py

```python
import pygame
from model import Direction

class InputHandler:
    def __init__(self, game):
        self.game = game

    def handle_event(self, event):
        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                self.game.snake.direction = Direction.UP
            elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                self.game.snake.direction = Direction.DOWN
            elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                self.game.snake.direction = Direction.LEFT
            elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                self.game.snake.direction = Direction.RIGHT
```

This is a basic implementation of the snake game using the MVC architecture. The main entry point is the `main.py` file, which initializes the game, renderer, and input handler, and runs the game loop. The `model.py` file contains the classes for the game model, including the snake, food, and game state. The `view.py` file handles rendering the game state on the screen. The `controller.py` file handles user input and updates the game state accordingly.
