Based on the requirements, here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for the snake game implementation:

1. Model:
- Snake: Represents the snake in the game. Responsible for maintaining the snake's position, length, and movement.
- Food: Represents the food in the game. Responsible for generating new food at random positions.
- Game: Represents the game state. Responsible for managing the game loop, updating the snake and food positions, and handling collisions.

2. View:
- Renderer: Responsible for rendering the game state on the screen.

3. Controller:
- InputHandler: Responsible for handling keyboard input and updating the snake's direction accordingly.

Now, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and implementing the code.

1. main.py
