Based on the MVC architecture, the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for the snake game are as follows:

1. Model:
   - Snake: Represents the snake in the game. Responsible for maintaining the snake's position, length, and movement.
   - Food: Represents the food in the game. Responsible for generating new food at random positions.
   - Game: Represents the game state. Responsible for managing the game logic, including collision detection and score tracking.

2. View:
   - Renderer: Responsible for rendering the game state on the screen.

3. Controller:
   - InputHandler: Responsible for handling user input and updating the game state accordingly.
