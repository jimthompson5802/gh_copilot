Based on the assumptions made, here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `app.py`: This is the entrypoint file that will contain the Flask application and handle the routing.

2. `templates/index.html`: This HTML template file will be used to render the "Hello World" web page.

Now, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and writing the code.

**app.py**
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=6000)
```

**templates/index.html**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

This is the complete code for the Python application. The `app.py` file sets up a Flask application, defines a route for the root URL ("/"), and renders the `index.html` template when the route is accessed. The `index.html` file contains the HTML code for the "Hello World" web page.

To run the application, make sure you have Flask installed. You can install it using `pip install flask`. Then, save the `app.py` and `templates/index.html` files in the same directory and run the `app.py` file using `python app.py`. The application will start listening on port 6000 and you can access the web page by visiting http://localhost:6000 in your web browser.
