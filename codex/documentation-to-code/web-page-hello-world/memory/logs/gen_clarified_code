The `app.py` file sets up a Flask application, defines a route for the root URL (\"/\"), and renders the `index.html` template when the route is accessed. The `index.html` file contains the HTML code for the \"Hello World\" web page.\n\nTo run the application, make sure you have Flask installed. You can install it using `pip install flask`. Then, save the `app.py` and `templates/index.html` files in the same directory and run the `app.py` file using `python app.py`. The application will start listening on port 6000 and you can access the web page by visiting http://localhost:6000 in your web browser."}]
