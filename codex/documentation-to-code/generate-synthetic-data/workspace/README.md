Based on the requirements, the following core classes, functions, and methods will be necessary:

1. `generate_synthetic_regression_dataset`: A function to generate the synthetic regression dataset.
2. `save_dataset_to_csv`: A function to save the generated dataset to a CSV file.
3. `main`: The entrypoint function to execute the program.

The program will consist of the following files:

1. `synthetic_regression.py`: The entrypoint file that contains the `main` function.
2. `dataset.py`: A module that contains the `generate_synthetic_regression_dataset` function.
3. `file_utils.py`: A module that contains the `save_dataset_to_csv` function.

Now, let's proceed with implementing the code for each file.

**synthetic_regression.py**
