Based on the requirements, here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `FileLoader` class: Responsible for loading the specified file and returning its contents.
   - `load_file(file_name: str) -> str`: Loads the specified file and returns its contents as a string.

2. `WebPage` class: Responsible for creating and rendering the web page.
   - `render(file_contents: str) -> str`: Renders the web page with the specified file contents.

3. `App` class: The main application class that brings everything together.
   - `run()`: Starts the application and listens for incoming connections.

Now let's proceed with creating the necessary files and their content.

1. `file_loader.py`

```python
import os


class FileLoader:
    @staticmethod
    def load_file(file_name: str) -> str:
        if not os.path.isfile(file_name):
            raise FileNotFoundError(f"File '{file_name}' not found.")
        
        with open(file_name, "r") as file:
            return file.read()
```

2. `web_page.py`

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)


class WebPage:
    @staticmethod
    def render(file_contents: str) -> str:
        return render_template("index.html", file_contents=file_contents)


@app.route("/")
def index():
    file_contents = ""  # Placeholder for file contents
    return WebPage.render(file_contents)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=6000)
```

3. `app.py`

```python
from file_loader import FileLoader
from web_page import app


class App:
    def run(self):
        app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=6000)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    App().run()
```

4. `index.html`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>File Viewer</title>
    <style>
        /* Add CSS styles for scrolling and responsiveness */
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <pre>{{ file_contents }}</pre>
</body>
</html>
```

Please note that the above code assumes the use of Flask as the web framework. You may need to install Flask using `pip install flask` and ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed.

Additionally, you will need to create a `templates` folder in the same directory as the `web_page.py` file and place the `index.html` file inside it.

To run the application, execute the `app.py` file using `python app.py`. The application will start listening on port 6000 and accept connections from any IP address.

Make sure to install the required dependencies and set up the project structure accordingly.
