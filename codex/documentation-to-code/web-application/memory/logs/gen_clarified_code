The primary goal is to create a user-friendly and responsive interface that makes it easy for users to explore the contents of different files.\n\nRequirements:\n1. The Python application should utilize appropriate web frameworks and technologies to create the web page. The application should listen on port 6060 and accept connections for any ip addresses.\n2. provide a means for the user to select a file to load for a list of available files. The file should be loaded from the local file system.\n3. Once a file is selected, its contents should be displayed on the web page with vertical and horizontal scrolling options.\n4. The web page should maintain responsiveness, ensuring smooth scrolling and rendering even for large files.\n5.
