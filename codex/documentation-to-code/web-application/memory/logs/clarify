The main functionality of the application involves loading a specified file and displaying its contents on a web page. The application should offer vertical and horizontal scrolling capabilities to handle files of varying lengths and widths. The primary goal is to create a user-friendly and responsive interface that makes it easy for users to explore the contents of different files.\n\nRequirements:\n1. The Python application should utilize appropriate web frameworks and technologies to create the web page. The application should listen on port 6060 and accept connections for any ip addresses.\n2. provide a means for the user to select a file to load for a list of available files. The file should be loaded from the local file system.\n3. Once a file is selected, its contents should be displayed on the web page with vertical and horizontal scrolling options.\n4. The web page should maintain responsiveness, ensuring smooth scrolling and rendering even for large files.\n5. Proper error handling should be implemented to handle cases when the file doesn't exist or if there are any other unexpected issues.\n6. The Python application should be well-documented and easy to set up and run.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Areas that need clarification:\n1.

For creating the web page, I will assume that popular web frameworks like Flask or Django can be used.\n2. The list of available files can be presented as a dropdown menu or a list of clickable file names.\n3. The file should be loaded and displayed in real-time as the user selects it.\n4. The vertical and horizontal scrolling options should be implemented using standard HTML and CSS techniques.\n5. There is no specific size range mentioned, so I will assume that the application should be able to handle files of any size.\n6. I will implement basic error handling, such as displaying an error message if the file doesn't exist or if there are any unexpected issues.\n7. The Python application should have sufficient documentation to explain its setup and usage, including any dependencies or configuration requirements."}]
