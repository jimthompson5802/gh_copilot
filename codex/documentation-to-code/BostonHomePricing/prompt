write a python program to do the following:
read data from ../../generate-synthetic-data/workspace/data/housing2.csv into a pandas dataframe 
First row is column headings.
Target variable is "MEDV".  
Preprocess the data by filling missing values with the median of the respective column, handling outliers using IQR method and Feature Scaling.
Evaluate the correlations between each feature versus target feature and remove the features that have a low correlation. 
Create multiple regression machine learning models to predict the target variable except Ridge. 
Create a 80% training and 20% test split.
Do NOT use deep learning algorithms.
print loss value at the end of model.
Save the models.
