Based on the requirements, we will need the following core classes, functions, and methods:

1. `load_data`: This function will load the data from the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
2. `preprocess_data`: This function will handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
3. `evaluate_correlations`: This function will evaluate the correlations between each feature and the target feature, and remove features with low correlation.
4. `split_data`: This function will split the data into a training set and a test set.
5. `train_models`: This function will train multiple regression models on the training data.
6. `evaluate_models`: This function will evaluate the models on the test data and print the loss value.
7. `save_models`: This function will save the trained models to disk.

Now, let's write the code for each of these functions.

main.py
