Based on the requirements and assumptions, here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `data_loader.py`:
   - `load_data()` - A function to load data from the synthetic_regression.csv file into a pandas DataFrame.

2. `dataset.py`:
   - `RegressionDataset` - A PyTorch dataset class that converts the pandas DataFrame into a PyTorch dataset.

3. `model.py`:
   - `NeuralNetwork` - A class that defines the structure of the neural network.

4. `train.py`:
   - `train_model()` - A function to train the neural network on the dataset.
   - `save_model()` - A function to save the trained model.

Now, let's create the necessary files and implement the code.

`data_loader.py`
