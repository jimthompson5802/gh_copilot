Based on the requirements, the following core classes, functions, and methods will be necessary:

1. `CSVLoader`: A class responsible for loading the CSV file into a PyTorch dataset.
   - `load_dataset(file_path)`: Loads the CSV file and returns a PyTorch dataset.

2. `NeuralNetwork`: A class representing the 4-layer neural network.
   - `__init__(input_size, hidden_size, output_size)`: Initializes the neural network with the specified input, hidden, and output sizes.
   - `forward(x)`: Performs a forward pass through the neural network.
   - `train(dataset, num_epochs, learning_rate)`: Trains the neural network on the given dataset for the specified number of epochs using the specified learning rate.
   - `save_model(file_path)`: Saves the trained model to a file.

Now let's proceed with creating the necessary files and implementing the code.
