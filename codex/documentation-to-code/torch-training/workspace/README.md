Based on the requirements and assumptions, the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary are:

1. `DataLoader`: A class responsible for loading the data from the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
   - `load_data()`: A method to read the data from the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.

2. `Dataset`: A class responsible for converting the pandas DataFrame into a PyTorch dataset.
   - `__init__()`: Initializes the Dataset object with the input features and target variable.
   - `__len__()`: Returns the length of the dataset.
   - `__getitem__()`: Returns a specific instance from the dataset.

3. `NeuralNetwork`: A class representing the 4-layer neural network.
   - `__init__()`: Initializes the neural network with the desired architecture.
   - `forward()`: Performs the forward pass of the neural network.

4. `train()`: A function responsible for training the neural network on the dataset.
   - `train_model()`: Trains the neural network on the training dataset for a specified number of epochs.
   - `calculate_loss()`: Calculates the loss value for a given set of predictions and targets.

5. `save_model()`: A function responsible for saving the trained model.

Now, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and implementing the code.
